# seleniumAutomation
For the automation code assessment, I have implemented the signup page automation using the BDD framework. The automation code covers positive and negative test cases, validating fields such as first name, last name, email ID, password, and confirm password. I have also incorporated necessary WebDriver initialization and the ability to capture screenshots for negative validation scenarios.
